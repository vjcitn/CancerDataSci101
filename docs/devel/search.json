It is a program developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI). Data are collected at 17 regional centers.\nThe SEER web site, offers various facets of cancer data to investigate.\n\n\nSEERlist\n\n\n1.4.2 Body sites with relatively high cancer incidence\n\n\nSEER 2021 pie charts\n\n\n1.4.3 New diagnoses, and deaths, over time\nA very broad overview of cancer‚Äôs impact on Americans over the past 20 years:\n\n\nSEER overview, 2021\n\n\n1.4.4 Exercises\nA.2.1 The display just above asserts that over 1.8 million Americans will present with a new cancer diagnosis in 2021. Re-express this prediction as a ‚Äúrate per 100,000 persons‚Äù.\nA.2.2 True or False: Of cancers newly identified in US citizens in 2021, more than 8% arise in the pancreas.\n\n1.4.5 Answers\nA.2.1\n\nA.2.2"

We can sort, search, filter these tables fairly easily. ‚ÄúData graphics‚Äù, also known as ‚Äústatistical visualization‚Äù, have been devised to help us get insights that have a different character. One objective is to develop a sense of variation in a quantity of interest, by aggregating data values in various ways and presenting these aggregates in graphical form.\n\n1.10.1 Histograms\nHistograms help visualize variability in a quantity of interest. The range of the quantity of interest is ‚Äúbinned‚Äù ‚Äì chopped up into intervals of equal width. Midpoints of bins are plotted on the x axis, and counts of values in bins are plotted on the y axis.\nWe illustrate with the CDC WONDER data on Prostate cancer incidence.\n\nmake_hist(site=\"Prostate\", binwidth=5, rate_table=littab)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the visual character of the histogram display by reducing the bin width.\n\nmake_hist(site=\"Prostate\", binwidth=2, rate_table=littab)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10.1.1 Exercises\nA.5.1 Based on the first histogram shown above, what is the most commonly observed value for prostate cancer incidence (per 100,000 men) in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of the United States?

Three of those were linked (with variable degree of certainty) to hypothesized exposures, but only one investigation revealed a clear cause.\n\nThe conclusion of this report:\n\nThere are fundamental shortcomings to our current methods of investigating community cancer clusters.
